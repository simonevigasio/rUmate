# rUmate

rUmate is a simple API that allows college students to post and display room ads that they are about to be let go and urgently need to find a replacement due to contractual deadlines.

To provide an interactive experience, we developed a straightforward Vue.js frontend application located in the ``frontend`` folder. You can try it following this link: https://rumate-1.onrender.com/

Instead, the web service is deployed with this link: https://rumate.onrender.com/
